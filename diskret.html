    <h2>Diskret matematik</h2>
    <p>
        The course introduces some of the basic elements of discrete mathematics, 
        set theory, combinatorics, modular arithmetic, 
        propositional and predicate logic and graph theory.
    </p>

    <p>The course includes the following elements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Basic integer math, modular arithmetic</li>
        <li>Numbers in different number bases</li>
        <li>Quantitative learning with applications</li>
        <li>Combinatorics with applications</li>
        <li>Mathematical recursion and induction</li>
        <li>RSA encryption and other cryptos</li>
        <li>Functions and relations between finite quantities, equivalence relations</li>
        <li>Basic graph theory</li>
        <li>Propositional logic, predicate logic, logical inference.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Final grade: 4</h3>

    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>The course is set up by six submissions consisting of each chapter of discrethe mathematics.
        The submissions is done in small groups. To finally exam the course, an examination is made.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal development</h3>
    <p>This course has increased my ability to cooperate with other people since working in on the submissions.
        Learning basic graph theory has helped better understand the tree system in programming. A deeper
        insight in numbers system made it easier for me understandning how things in programming is set up.
